# Personal-Website-React-
This repository will be about my Personal Website as a Computer Science Student at CSUF where I try with React and its libraries instead of raw HTML compared to my previous repository with the same function and see what I can do

# Wishlist
I would like to add a 3d model to the website for the user to interact with and try to push myself to see what I can achieve

# Other Libraries
react-rnd â€“ a popular React component for resizable & draggable containers.

# Theme of design
I used the inspiration of Needy Streamer Overload because I love its theme and design as I listen to their music, which is made by Aiobahn, and their notable songs [Internet Overdose](https://youtu.be/BnkhBwzBqlQ?si=SyRhR1s1OefVCcP0) and [Internet Yamero](https://youtu.be/51GIxXFKbzk?si=E6QtOmIHrvcN8hMK)

Note: I never played the game but I love the music since I listen to the artist
